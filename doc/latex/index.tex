2, HDF5


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cd tools3rd}
\DoxyCodeLine{> tar zxvf hdf5-\/1.12.0.tar.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cd hdf5-\/1.12.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> ./autogen.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{> ./configure -\/-\/enable-\/parallel -\/-\/prefix=\$PWD/build CC=mpicc}
\DoxyCodeLine{>  make install}

\end{DoxyCode}


3, DASH


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cd tools3rd}
\DoxyCodeLine{> tar zxvf dash.tar.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{  (or git clone https://github.com/dash-\/project/dash.git )}
\DoxyCodeLine{> vim build.minimal.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Change }

\DoxyCodeLine{  To}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/DINSTALL\_PREFIX=\$PWD/install}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Your may also need to setup HDF5\_ROOT to HDF5 installation directory if DASH can not find HDF5}
\DoxyCodeLine{> ./build.minimal.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{> make -\/C ./build install }

\end{DoxyCode}


4, Fast\+Tensor
