**** NOTE: This code developed to work only with VPIC. One may extract the HDF5 related code and reuse it, 
**** but this code as it is may work with VPIC decks. 

Please add following lines in your VPIC deck file. At the same time, you need to disable original file dump.

if( should_dump(fields) ){ 
    //Comment out the original one
    //field_dump(global->fdParams);
    #include "dump_field_with_hdf5.cc"
}

if(should_dump(ehydro)){ 
    //Comment out the original one 
    //hydro_dump("ion", global->hHdParams); 
    const char * speciesname = "electron"; 
    #include "dump_hydro_with_hdf5.cc" 
}

if(should_dump(Hhydro)){ 
    //Comment out the original one
    //hydro_dump("ion", global->hHdParams); 
    const char * speciesname = "ion"; 
    #include "dump_hydro_with_hdf5.cc"
}

char subdir[36]; 
if ( should_dump(eparticle) && step() !=0 && step() > 0*(global->fields_interval) ) { 
    sprintf(subdir,"particle/T.%d",step()); 
    dump_mkdir(subdir);
    //Comment out the original ones 
    //dump_particles("ion",subdir); 
    #include "dump_particle_with_hdf5.cc"
}

Note that, for ehydro/Hhydro, we only dump some important attributes.
