This package contains the FastTensor, a new version of ArrayUDF from the project SDS (Scientific Data Services) framework at LBNL. This project is supported by the DOE.  
See copyright at the end. 
Please report any problem you've encountered in using this package to  Bin Dong: dbin@lbl.gov

1, Required software packages:

```
   Note:
          1), Install MPICH2 before HDF5 to enable the parallel I/O in HDF5
          2), add mpicc/mpicxx/mpirun from MPICH2 installation to your PATH
          3), add h5dump from HDF5 installation to your PATH
	  
   -- MPICH2 from http://www.mpich.org/ 
      (tested version: http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.2/mpich-3.2.tar.gz)
   -- HDF5 from https://www.hdfgroup.org/
       https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/

   -- DASH from  https://github.com/dash-project/dash/   
```

2, HDF5

```
 > cd tools3rd
 > tar zxvf hdf5-1.12.0.tar.gz
 > cd hdf5-1.12.0
 > ./autogen.sh
 > ./configure --enable-parallel --prefix=$PWD/build CC=mpicc
 >  make install
```

3, DASH

```
 > cd tools3rd
 > tar zxvf dash.tar.gz
   (or git clone https://github.com/dash-project/dash.git )
 > vim build.minimal.sh
   Change 
      -DENABLE_HDF5=OFF 
   To   
      -DENABLE_HDF5=ON
 
   Change 
     -DINSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/opt/dash-0.4.0/
   To
     -DINSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install

   Your may also need to setup HDF5_ROOT to HDF5 installation directory if DASH can not find HDF5
 > ./build.minimal.sh
 > make -C ./build install 

```

4, FastTensor

```
 > ./configure --prefix=$PWD/build --with-hdf5=../hdf5-1.12.0/build/build/ CXX=mpic++ CC=mpicc --with-dash=/Users/dbin/opt/dash-0.4.0/
```


5, Error issue with DASH/C++ compiler:

```
/Users/dbin/opt/dash-0.4.0//include/cpp17/cstddef.h:12:12: error:
      redefinition of 'byte'
enum class byte : unsigned char {};
```

You can resolve it by 

```
  cp dash/cstddef.h ~/opt/dash-0.4.0/include/cpp17/
```
